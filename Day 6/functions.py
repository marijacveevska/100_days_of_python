# Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again.

# examples
print("Hello")
num_char = len("Hello")
print(num_char)

# Defining a function
def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")

# Calling a function
my_function()
